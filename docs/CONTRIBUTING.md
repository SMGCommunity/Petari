We will be glad to answer any questions <br>
for people who wish to contribute.

All pull requests and issues are welcome.

<br>

### Before Submission

Be sure that all of your submitted code <br>
follows the guidelines that are listed below.

When running `make`, it is **REQUIRED** that the output is `1:1`.

After the code matches, be sure to run `scripts/check.py` <br>
to check the function that you want to mark.

If it matches, it will automatically be marked as decompiled.

## Requirements

<br>

### Tools

- A **Disassembler** / **IDA Pro** / **Ghidra**

    *You can also use a decompiler, it can make some things easier*
    
- **CodeWarrior** 
    
    *We specifically use version `3.0a3`*
    
- **Python**

    *Version `3.7+`*

<br>

### Knowledge

- **C** / **C++**

    *However **C++** is recommended*
    
- **PowerPC Assembly**

- **PowerPC** ‚ûù **C** / **C++** reverse engineering instructions 

<br>

*Decompilers such as Hex-Rays (included in IDA Pro) are* <br>
*useful as they can make the decompilation easier to write.*

## Guidelines

<br>

### General

<br>

- Lines should not exceed `100` characters, <br>
  these can be split into multiple lines.
  
- Use `NULL` instead of `0` when assigning / comparing a pointer.
  
  *Only use `0` when assigning or comparing a value.*

<br>

### Headers

<br>

- Use `forward-declared` types when possible

- At the top of every header place:

    ```c++
    #pragma once
    ```
    

<br>

### Includes

<br>

- For system library includes use:

    ```c++
    #include <...>
    ```
    
- For game header includes use:

    ```c++
    #include "..."
    ```
    
    *These includes must be relative to the `include` folder.*

<br>

### Names

<br>

- Names for known symbols should match **exactly**, <br>
  even including typos in the symbol.

- Member variables must be prefixed with `m`.

- Arguments for functions must be prefixed with:

    - `p` for pointers 

    - `r` for passed-by-reference
    
- Static variables with:

    - No known symbol must be prefixed with `s`

    - Global scope must be prefixed with `g`
    
- Functions with no symbols must use **camelCase**.

    *Such as **inlined** functions.*

<br>

### Classes

<br>

- When referencing a class member, do **not** use <br>
  `this ->`, unless it is required for compilation.

- Functions for classes must be put in the following order: 
    
    - Constructor
    
    - Destructor
    
    - Operators
    
    - Virtual Functions
    
    - Member Functions
    
    *If the virtual functions are not in the order that* <br>
    *they are in the **vtable**, then the rule above can be* <br>
    *ignored as these functions must be placed in order.*
    

<br>

### Nonmatching Code

If your code does **NOT** match, use the <br>
`NONMATCHING` macro, and explain in a <br>
comment why it does not match.

<br>

### Types

If the function arguments in the symbol use `int`, <br>
do **NOT** use `s32`, you have to use `int`, as they <br>
do not mangle to the same symbol.
