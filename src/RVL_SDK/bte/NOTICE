This decompilation of the BTE library contains code from bluedroid
<https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/bluetooth/bluedroid>,
commits 5738f83 and ead3cde, and references code from esp-idf
<https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf> (no specific commit here. whatever main
is at, I guess. I had already decompiled the relevant code by then; I just used
it for naming things).

This is a decompilation of a library, *not* a port of one. It is drastically
different from the original code, both in style and organization. The main focus
here is trying to recreate old code, document bugs, and note curiosities, *not*
to retrofit a highly configurable library onto its distant ancestor's shadow
with minimal changes.

One of the major changes I made was hardcoding settings of and removing most
other aspects of the configuration system. Many things previously in uncompiled
blocks are now simply absent; they might have been there in the original, but
they didn't get compiled here and so don't need to be here. Other changes
include completely replacing the logging macro interface, moving many things
around between headers, in between headers and source files sometimes, adding
new things, deleting old things (or just not including them), changing macro
enums to language enums, adding more typedefs so it's more easily recognizable
what things mean, and also the general style and formatting of everything.

tl;dr this code does not look like bluedroid i know that it does not look like
bluedroid do not complain to me that it does not look like bluedroid
